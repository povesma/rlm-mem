# Generate Technical Design with RLM-Mem Hybrid Analysis

Create a technical design informed by past architectural decisions (claude-mem) and current code patterns (RLM).

## When to Use

- After PRD is approved
- When planning implementation approach
- Before breaking down into tasks

## Process

### Step 1: Load Context

**Read PRD**:
- From file: `tasks/{jira-id}-{feature}/...-prd.md`
- Or search claude-mem for recent PRD

**Search past tech designs** (claude-mem):
```
mcp__plugin_claude-mem_mcp-search__search(
  query="{feature_keywords} architecture design patterns technical",
  type="TECH-DESIGN",
  limit=5
)
```

### Step 2: RLM Architecture Discovery

**Discover existing patterns**:
```bash
python3 ~/.claude/rlm_scripts/rlm_repl.py exec <<'PY'
# Find architecture-relevant files
arch_files = []

# Look for main architectural components
patterns = ['handler', 'service', 'controller', 'manager', 'repository', 'model']
for pattern in patterns:
    matches = [
        path for path, meta in repo_index['files'].items()
        if pattern in path.lower()
        and meta['lang'] in ['C++', 'C/C++', 'TypeScript', 'Python']
        and not meta['is_binary']
    ]
    arch_files.extend(matches[:5])  # Top 5 per pattern

print('\n'.join(set(arch_files)[:30]))
PY
```

**Analyze patterns with rlm-subcall**:
- Query: "Extract architectural patterns: layering, dependency injection, error handling, data flow, module structure"
- Files: Top 10 most representative architecture files
- Collect: Design patterns, conventions, anti-patterns

### Step 3: Identify Integration Points

**Find where new code will connect**:
```bash
python3 ~/.claude/rlm_scripts/rlm_repl.py exec <<'PY'
# Based on PRD requirements, find integration points
# Example: If adding auth, find where current auth is used

integration_points = {
    'will_modify': [],   # Existing files we'll change
    'will_create': [],   # New files we'll add
    'dependencies': [],  # External deps we'll use
}

# Analyze based on feature requirements
# ...

import json
print(json.dumps(integration_points, indent=2))
PY
```

### Step 4: Learn from History

**Query past decisions** (claude-mem):
```
mcp__plugin_claude-mem_mcp-search__search(
  query="why we chose {relevant_tech} architecture decision trade-offs",
  limit=5
)
```

Extract:
- Past architectural decisions and rationale
- Trade-offs made and lessons learned
- Patterns that worked well
- Patterns that caused problems

### Step 5: Ask Technical Clarifying Questions (MANDATORY)

**🚨 BEFORE writing the technical design, you MUST ask clarifying questions
using the AskUserQuestion tool.** Adapt questions based on the feature, but
common technical areas to explore:

- **Architecture Pattern:** "What architectural pattern should this follow?"
- **Technology Stack:** "Are there specific technologies or libraries that must
  be used?"
- **Integration Points:** "What existing systems will this feature integrate
  with?"
- **Data Storage:** "What are the data storage requirements?"
- **Performance Constraints:** "Are there specific performance requirements?"
- **External Dependencies:** "Does this feature depend on external services?"
- **Error Handling:** "What error handling and recovery strategies should be
  used?"
- **State Management:** "How should state be managed?"

**Architecture Trade-offs (informed by RLM findings from Steps 2-3):**
- "I found patterns [X] and [Y] in the codebase. Which should this feature
  follow?"
- "Existing [component] uses [approach]. Should we extend it or build new?"
- "Past design for [similar feature] used [pattern]. Reuse or diverge?"

Always include an **"All clear, proceed"** option for users with clear
requirements. If user selects it, skip to Step 6.

**Take the user's answers and incorporate them into the design below. Do NOT
leave answered questions in an "Open Questions" section.**

### Step 6: Synthesize Technical Design

Create design document:

```markdown
# {JIRA-ID}: {Feature Name} - Technical Design

**Status**: Draft
**PRD**: [{JIRA-ID}-prd.md](link)
**Created**: {date}

## Overview

{High-level technical approach}

## Current Architecture (RLM Analysis)

**Discovered Patterns**:
- {Pattern 1 from codebase}
- {Pattern 2 from codebase}

**Relevant Components**:
- {Component 1}: {Description + file locations}
- {Component 2}: {Description + file locations}

## Past Decisions (Claude-Mem)

**Relevant Historical Context**:
- {Decision 1 from past}: {Why it matters for this feature}
- {Decision 2}: {Lesson learned}

## Proposed Design

### Architecture

- Domain Layer: {What we'll add/modify}
- Infrastructure: {What we'll add/modify}

### Components

**New Components**:
1. **{Component Name}**
   - **Purpose**: {Why}
   - **Location**: {Where in codebase}

**Next Steps**:
1. Review and approve design
2. Run `/rlm-mem:plan:tasks` for task breakdown

### Step 7: Save to Claude-Mem

```
mcp__plugin_claude-mem_mcp-search__save_memory(
  text=f"[JIRA: {jira_id}]\n[TYPE: TECH-DESIGN]\n\n{design_content}",
  title=f"{jira_id} - Technical Design",
  project=project_name
)
```

### Step 8: Save to File

```
tasks/{jira-id}-{feature}/{date}-{jira-id}-{feature}-tech-design.md
```

## Final Instructions

1. Load PRD and search past designs
2. Use RLM to discover existing patterns
3. Identify integration points via RLM
4. Learn from historical decisions via claude-mem
5. **🚨 MANDATORY: Ask technical clarifying questions using AskUserQuestion tool**
6. Synthesize design incorporating user's answers + RLM + claude-mem insights
7. Save to both systems
