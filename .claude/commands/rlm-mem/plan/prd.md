# Generate PRD with RLM-Mem Hybrid Analysis

Create a Product Requirements Document informed by both historical context (claude-mem) and current codebase capabilities (RLM).

## When to Use

- Planning a new feature
- After `/rlm-mem:discover:start` has provided session context
- When you need a data-driven, context-aware PRD

## What This Command Does

1. **Searches past PRDs** (claude-mem) to learn structure and quality
2. **Analyzes current codebase** (RLM) to understand capabilities
3. **Synthesizes** a PRD that builds on existing work
4. **Saves** PRD to claude-mem for future reference

## Process

### Step 1: Gather Requirements from User

Ask the user for feature details:
- **JIRA ID**: (e.g., AS-1234) - required for file organization
- **Feature name**: Short descriptive name
- **User problem**: What problem does this solve?
- **Expected outcome**: What should the user be able to do?

### Step 2: Search Claude-Mem for Past PRDs

**2a. Find similar past features**:
```
mcp__plugin_claude-mem_mcp-search__search(
  query="{feature_name} requirements user stories similar features",
  project="{project_name}",
  type="PRD",
  limit=5
)
```

**2b. Get full details of best matches**:
```
mcp__plugin_claude-mem_mcp-search__get_observations(
  ids=[top_3_relevant_ids]
)
```

**Extract from past PRDs**:
- PRD structure and sections used
- Quality of user stories (format, detail level)
- Acceptance criteria patterns
- How requirements were scoped

### Step 3: RLM Analysis of Current Capabilities

**3a. Find related existing features**:
```bash
python3 ~/.claude/rlm_scripts/rlm_repl.py exec <<'PY'
# Search for files related to this feature
# Example: if feature is "OAuth2 auth", search for auth files

search_terms = ['{feature_keyword1}', '{feature_keyword2}']
relevant_files = []

for term in search_terms:
    # Find files by name pattern
    matches = [
        path for path, meta in repo_index['files'].items()
        if term.lower() in path.lower()
        and not meta['is_binary']
        and meta['lang'] in ['C++', 'C/C++', 'Python', 'TypeScript', 'JavaScript']
    ]
    relevant_files.extend(matches)

# Remove duplicates
relevant_files = list(set(relevant_files))[:20]

# Print for analysis
import json
print(json.dumps({
    'found': len(relevant_files),
    'files': relevant_files
}))
PY
```

**3b. Analyze architecture patterns** (if relevant files found):

Use rlm-subcall subagent to analyze sample files:
- Query: "Identify existing architecture patterns, API structure, data models, and integration points that relate to this feature"
- Limit: Top 3-5 most relevant files
- Collect findings about current capabilities

**3c. Identify gaps**:
```bash
python3 ~/.claude/rlm_scripts/rlm_repl.py exec <<'PY'
# What's missing for this feature?
# Example: Do we have auth infrastructure? Do we have API endpoints?

capabilities = {
    'existing': [],  # What we have
    'missing': [],   # What we need to build
}

# Based on RLM analysis and file discovery
# Document current state

print(json.dumps(capabilities, indent=2))
PY
```

### Step 4: Ask Clarifying Questions (MANDATORY)

**🚨 BEFORE writing the PRD, you MUST ask clarifying questions using the
AskUserQuestion tool.** The goal is to understand the "what" and "why" of the
feature. Adapt questions based on the prompt, but common areas to explore:

- **Problem/Goal:** "What problem does this feature solve for the user?" or
  "What is the main business goal we want to achieve?"
- **Target Users:** "Who are the primary users of this feature?"
- **Success Metrics:** "How will we measure success? What metrics matter most?"
- **Use Cases:** "What are the main use cases this feature should support?"
- **Feature Scope:** "What should this feature include? What should it
  explicitly NOT include?"
- **Acceptance Criteria:** "What are the key acceptance criteria that define
  'done' for this feature?"
- **Dependencies:** "Does this feature depend on other systems or services?"
- **Risks:** "What are the main risks or potential blockers?"

**Technical Context Questions (informed by RLM findings from Step 3):**
- "I found [pattern from RLM]. Should this feature follow the same approach?"
- "Existing [similar feature] handles [X]. Should we integrate or build new?"
- "Current architecture uses [finding]. Any constraints for this feature?"

Always include an **"All clear, proceed"** option for users with clear
requirements. If user selects it, skip to Step 5.

**Take the user's answers and incorporate them into the PRD below. Do NOT leave
answered questions in an "Open Questions" section.**

### Step 5: Synthesize PRD

Create PRD combining insights + user's clarifications:

```markdown
# {JIRA-ID}: {Feature Name} - PRD

**Status**: Draft
**Created**: {date}
**JIRA**: [{JIRA-ID}](https://jira.example.com/browse/{JIRA-ID})
**Author**: Claude (via rlm-mem analysis)

---

**Next Steps**:
1. Review and refine this PRD
2. Run `/rlm-mem:plan:tech-design` to create technical design
3. Run `/rlm-mem:plan:tasks` to break down into tasks
```

### Step 6: Save PRD to Claude-Mem

```
mcp__plugin_claude-mem_mcp-search__save_memory(
  text=f"""[JIRA: {jira_id}]
[TYPE: PRD]
[PROJECT: {project_name}]
[STATUS: Draft]

{full_prd_content}
""",
  title=f"{jira_id} - {feature_name} PRD",
  project=project_name
)
```

### Step 7: Save PRD to File System

```bash
# Create task directory
mkdir -p tasks/{jira_id}-{feature_name_slug}

# Write PRD file
# tasks/{jira_id}-{feature_name_slug}/{YYYY-MM-DD}-{jira_id}-{feature_name_slug}-prd.md
```

### Step 8: Report Completion

```markdown
# ✅ PRD Created: {JIRA-ID}

**Feature**: {Feature Name}
**File**: `tasks/{jira_id}-{feature_name_slug}/{date}-{jira_id}-{feature_name_slug}-prd.md`

## Insights Used

### From Claude-Mem:
- Analyzed {n} past PRDs
- Learned structure from: {best_example_jira_id}
- Referenced similar feature: {similar_feature}

### From RLM:
- Analyzed {m} relevant files
- Discovered existing capabilities: {summary}
- Identified integration points: {list}
- Noted constraints: {constraints}

## Quality Improvements

Thanks to hybrid analysis, this PRD:
✅ Follows proven structure from past PRDs
✅ Aware of current codebase capabilities
✅ References actual integration points
✅ Scoped based on existing patterns
✅ Includes realistic constraints

## Next Steps

**Create technical design**:
```
/rlm-mem:plan:tech-design
```

**Or refine PRD first**:
- Review user stories
- Validate acceptance criteria
- Confirm scope
```

## Important Notes

1. **Quality from Examples**:
   - Use past PRDs as quality benchmarks
   - Don't just copy structure, learn what makes them good
   - Adapt to current feature needs

2. **Grounded in Reality**:
   - RLM analysis shows what actually exists
   - Don't assume capabilities, verify with code
   - Constraints come from actual architecture

3. **Iterative**:
   - This is a draft, expect refinement
   - User feedback may change requirements
   - Technical design may reveal gaps

4. **Save Everything**:
   - Save to both claude-mem and file system
   - File system: team collaboration
   - Claude-mem: future AI context
