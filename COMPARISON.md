# Comparison: RLM-Mem vs Claude Code RLM

This document compares `rlm-mem` with the original [claude_code_RLM](https://github.com/brainqub3/claude_code_RLM) project that inspired it.

## 🙏 Acknowledgment

**RLM-Mem is built on the foundation of [claude_code_RLM](https://github.com/brainqub3/claude_code_RLM)** by [Brainqub3](https://brainqub3.com/).

The original project demonstrated how to implement Recursive Language Models using Claude Code for processing large text documents. We extended this concept to work with large code repositories and integrated it with claude-mem for historical context.

**Thank you to the claude_code_RLM team for the excellent starting point!**

## 📝 Technical Differences

### rlm_repl.py Enhancements

**Original (`claude_code_RLM`):**
```python
# Commands: init, status, exec, reset, export-buffers
python3 rlm_repl.py init context.txt  # Single file
```

**Extended (`rlm-mem`):**
```python
# Commands: init, init-repo, status, exec, reset, export-buffers
python3 rlm_repl.py init-repo .  # Entire repository
```

**New features in rlm-mem:**
- `init-repo` command for repository indexing
- Language detection for 50+ file types
- Binary file detection and handling
- Git integration (respects `.gitignore`)
- Repository statistics and metrics
- File categorization (source/test/config/doc/binary)

### Subagent Enhancements

**Original (`claude_code_RLM`):**
- Generic text analysis
- Simple relevance extraction
- No code-specific features

**Enhanced (`rlm-mem`):**
- Code-aware analysis
- Symbol extraction (classes, functions, variables)
- Pattern detection (architectural patterns)
- Dependency tracking
- File type categorization
- Multiple language support

### Workflow Integration

**Original (`claude_code_RLM`):**
- Single `/rlm` skill
- Manual process
- No lifecycle support

**Extended (`rlm-mem`):**
- 12 specialized commands
- Full development lifecycle
- Planning phase (PRD, tech-design, tasks)
- Development phase (impl, build, test)
- Review phase (PR review)
- Git integration (smart commits)
- Historical learning via claude-mem

## 💡 Relationship to Original

**RLM-Mem is:**
- ✅ Built on claude_code_RLM's foundation
- ✅ An **extension** for code repositories (not a replacement for text analysis)
- ✅ A **superset** of functionality (includes everything from original + more)
- ✅ A **separate project** with different goals (code vs text)

**RLM-Mem is NOT:**
- ❌ A fork of claude_code_RLM (different use case)
- ❌ A replacement for claude_code_RLM (complements it)
- ❌ Unrelated to claude_code_RLM (builds on its concepts)
